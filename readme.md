# Capstone Readme


### Intro

Title: Storia

Storia is a web app for children to learn to read with interactive storybooks. It turns plain stories into interactive stories with an analyses of the child's progress. 

It is divided into two main parts: 

   1. user interactivity with the storybook page (video opening, play video, record audio, click and hear words, unscramble words and sentences, chapter navigation, earning merits)
   2. collects user interface data, stores the data, visualizes and analyzes the data and shares the data.

### Setup

1. Media folders are built and filed by multiple upload functions built within the apps.models.  Visual, audio and video media is managed through the admin, built in Django.
2. There are three types of users: 
    a. superuser (me) --  creates and manages the storybook pages and the entire website through the admin.  
    b. child/parent or teacher/student -- access their own bookshelf and storybooks, a merit dashboard to observe progress.  (Audio, word/sentence scrambles, and message interaction to be added at a later date.)
    c. author (future feature)-- access his or her dashboard that monitors user interactivity with the interactive online storybook books that he or she has authored.  This publishing feature can be done multiple ways such as embedding into the author's website or maintained in the Storia library.  Both will require deployments to be further explored and decided upon.
3. REST Framework and other useful APIs 
4. Initial development with db_sqlite3.  As project develops move to  PostgreSQL.
5. Deploy to AWS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Heroku.

### Usage

Storia is an app to make interactive storybooks for children learning to read.  Storia can be used by native English speaking readers or EFL/ESL students learning English.  A user chooses/buys the books to be added to their bookshelf.  From here, the user clicks the cover of the storybook he or she wants to read which sends them to the opening page of the story where the user can begin at the beginning or choose a page.  

Each storybook page is interactive.  The user can watch a full screen video of the storypage, click and hear each word, click the avatar icon to see his or her Reading Chart that shows the users reading progress, record his or her self telling the story, navigate to other pages of the story, and message option where user sends and receives messages from parent.  

User interactions on the storypage are stored in the database.  These are then analyzed and sorted into 'merits' that show the students progress while learning to read.  

The process of designing and building each storybook is built into the Django admin.  All text and assets are stored in the database.  Using templates, template tags and template variables each storybook page is designed and shown on the webpage.  Each storybook page is NOT hardcoded but compiled upon requests to the server (lots of Django fun).
